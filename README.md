# MBD-Development-and-Simulation
using Pilot Input Device,MATLAB/SIMULINK,FlightGear to develop a airplane. 

(1) the Pilot Input Device include Yoke for Elevator and Aileron Control, Rudder,and Throttle

(3）using FlightGear to display aircraft motion and flight trajectory.
 I linked the Model to two FlightGears,one for Local Computer display,another for Remotely Computer display via UDP.
